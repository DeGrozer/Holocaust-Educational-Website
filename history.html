      Years before leading up to the holocaust, Jewish communities within Europe
      faced countless challenges, ranging from <a id="highlight"
        href="https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/anti-semitism/medieval-antisemitism/" target='_blank'>economic and
        social marginalination
        to prosecution</a>. Despite these, many Jews and their families were able to cultivate
      rich and fulfilling lives, tracing back its roots in their cultural tradition and
      religious beliefs. Jewish communities thrived and contributed to the society that
      they belong to . However, the rise of <a id="highlight" href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Fascism.html"
        target='_blank'>facism</a> that fueled anti-semitism against them
      led to one of the darkest periods in human history. By exploring the experiences of
      Jewish communities in the years leading up to the Holocaust, we can gain a deeper
      understanding of the historical forces that led to this tragedy and the lessons
      we can learn from it today.

        <hr class="hr-3">
        <br>


        Before we proceed to the events, let us discuss where the term
        <a id="highlight">Holocaust</a> comes from. The term comes from the Greek term <a
          id="highlight"><i>holókaustos</i></a>, which means “<b>burnt
          offering</b>" or “<b>whole burnt sacrifice</b>.” </br> </br>

        <figure class="container">
          <img src="media/news.png" alt="Trulli" id="picture">
          <figcaption><i>Armenian Massacre</i></figcaption>
        </figure>


        That term was used first in <a id="highlight" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/learning/teaching-about-the-armenian-genocide-with-the-new-york-times.html
            " target='_blank'>The New York Times in 1965</a> to describe
        the massacre of the <a id="highlight" href="https://www.goarch.org/whats-new/-/asset_publisher/rlvS19snJYAk/content/what-is-an-armenian-christian-
        " target='_blank'>Armenian Christians</a> by the <a id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide#:~:text=The%20Armenian%20genocide%20was%20the,death%20marches%20to%20the%20Syrian
        " target='_blank'>Ottoman Empire</a>.
        In the Jewish community, the term Shoah, which means “<b>calamity</b>” or
        “<b>disaster</b>”, has been used to refer to the genocide.
        This term was first used to describe the events in Germany by <a id="highlight">Yehuda
          Erez</a>, and later by <a id="highlight">Davar and Haaretz</a> in September 1939.
        The American Hebrew used the "<b>before the Holocaust</b>" in 1941 to
        <a id="highlight"
          href="https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/life-in-nazi-occupied-europe/occupation-case-studies/france/"
          target='_blank'>describe the situation in France</a>, and the New York Times referred to
        "<a id="highlight"
          href=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/04/27/archives/compromise-seen-on-refugee-help-bermuda-conference-believed-agreed.html
          target="_blank">hundreds of thousands of European Jews still surviving the Nazi
          Holocaust</a>" in <b>1943</b>.
        </br> </br>
        However, it wasn't until the NBC mini-series "<a id="highlight" href=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077025/
          target="_blank">Holocaust</a>" aired in
        1978 that the term gained widespread use in the United States.</br> </br>

        The Holocaust is commonly defined as the genocide of the European
        Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945.
        However, some historians prefer a definition that includes other
        groups targeted by the Nazis.
        </br>
        According to <a id="highlight">Donald Niewyk</a> and <a id="highlight">Francis Nicosia</a>, in The Columbia
        Guide to the Holocaust, the Holocaust should be defined as "<a id="highlight">the
          systematic, state-sponsored murder of entire groups determined by
          heredity.</a>" This definition includes not only Jews, but also <a id="highlight">Roma</a> and
        <a id="highlight">disabled people</a>.


        Other groups targeted by the Nazis after Hitler became Chancellor of
        Germany in 1933 include those whom they viewed as inherently
        inferior, such as some Slavic people, particularly <a id="highlight"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people" target="_blank">Poles</a> and
        <a id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russians" target="_blank">Russians</a>, the <a
          id="highlight"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people#:~:text=The%20Romani%20(also%20spelled%20Romany,significant%20concentrations%20in%20the%20Americas./"
          target="_blank">Roma</a>, and the <a id="highlight">disabled</a>. </br> </br>

        Also, the Nazis targeted those with certain beliefs or
        behaviors, such as <a id="highlight">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, <a id="highlight">communists</a>, and <a
          id="highlight">homosexuals</a>.
        The persecution of these groups was less uniform than that of the
        Jews.
        For example, the Nazis' treatment of the <a id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavs"
          target="_blank">Slavs</a> consisted of
        "<a id="highlight">enslavement and gradual attrition</a>", while some Slavs were favored.
        On the other hand, Hitler regarded the Jews as "<a id="highlight"><i><b>a Gegenrasse</b></i></a>: a
        'counter-race' ... not really human at all", according to historian
        <a id="highlight"
          href="
            https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/15/the-holocaust-an-unfinished-history-by-dan-stone-review-a-timely-corrective-to-a-shifting-narrative"

        In this
        blog, we will divide the
        Holocaust into several key events and explore what happened during
        each.

        <a id="highlight" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nazi-Party" target='_blank'>The Nazi Party</a>, led by
        Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany in
        1933.
        Hitler used propaganda to spread <a id="highlight"
          href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Nazi-anti-Semitism-and-the-Holocaust"
          target='_blank'>anti-Semitic beliefs</a>, blaming
        Jewish people
        for Germany's economic troubles and societal issues. <a id="highlight"
          href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nurnberg-Laws" target='_blank'>The Nuremberg
          Laws</a> were passed in 1935,
        stripping Jewish people of their citizenship and rights. This set
        the stage for the brutal events
        that would occur during the Holocaust.

        </figure>


        </br>
        On November 9th, 1938, the Nazis organized a coordinated attack on
        Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues across Germany. This event,
        known as <a id="highlight"
          href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Nazi-anti-Semitism-and-the-Holocaust"
          target='_blank'>Kristallnacht</a> or the "<i>Night of Broken Glass</i>," resulted in
        the destruction of thousands of Jewish properties, the arrest of
        tens of thousands of Jewish individuals, and the murder of over 90
        people.

        </br>
        Beginning in 1939, Jewish people were forcibly relocated into
        <a id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto" target='_blank'>ghettos</a> throughout <a
          id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe" target='_blank'>Eastern Europe</a>. Ghettos
        were often overcrowded
        and lacked basic resources, resulting in the spread of disease and
        starvation. Many people died as a result of these conditions.

        In 1941, the <a id="highlight" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Einsatzgruppen"
          target='_blank'>Einsatzgruppen</a>, or mobile killing squads, were formed
        to carry out mass executions of Jewish people. These squads would

        <a id="highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps" target='_blank'>Concentration
          camps</a> were established throughout Europe to imprison
        and kill Jewish people and other minorities. Prisoners were

          id="highlight">torture</a>. The
        largest concentration camp was Auschwitz-Birkenau,, where over <a id="highlight">1 million

        involved transporting millions of Jewish people to concentration

        <h2 style="color:#af2f23" id="one"> LIBERATION </h2>
        <hr class="hr-3">
        <br>


        The liberation of the concentration camps marked the end of the Holocaust
        and the beginning of a long process of recovery and healing for the survivors.
        The liberation began in the spring of 1945, as <a id="highlight"
          href="https://www.ducksters.com/history/world_war_ii/ww2_allied_powers.php" target="_blank"> Allied forces</a>
        advanced across Europe
        and <a id="highlight">began to free the prisoners</a> in the camps.

          <figcaption><i>Newly liberated prisoners behind a stockade</i></figcaption>
        </figure>

        When the soldiers arrived at the camps, they were often confronted with scenes
        of unimaginable horror. Many prisoners were emaciated and suffering from disease
        and malnutrition. The bodies of those who had died from starvation, disease, or
        murder were often piled up in mass graves or crematoria.
        <br><br>
        Survivors of the camps
        were often traumatized and in shock, having endured years of unimaginable suffering
        and loss.
        Despite the horrors they had witnessed, the liberating soldiers did their best to
        provide care and assistance to the survivors. Medical personnel treated the sick
        and wounded, while others distributed food and water to the starving prisoners.
        Many soldiers were shocked and deeply affected by what they saw, and some struggled
        to come to terms with the atrocities they had witnessed.
        In the months following the liberation, <a id="highlight"
          href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-survivors" target='_blank'>the process of
          identifying and caring for
          the survivors began</a>.

        <a id="highlight" href="https://www.icrc.org/en/document/icrc-wwii-holocaust" target='_blank'>The International
          Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations</a>
        played a key role in this effort, providing medical care, food, and shelter to those
        who had been liberated.
        However, the process of recovery was not easy. Many survivors had lost their
        families, homes, and communities, and struggled to rebuild their lives.
        In addition, many faced discrimination and persecution in the years that followed,
        as they attempted to rebuild their lives in a world that had been forever changed by
        the Holocaust.
